# 🌐 COVID-19 Visualization Project

This project uses **R** to analyze and visualize the global spread of COVID-19. It leverages datasets and powerful visualization libraries to present insights into the pandemic's progression and impact.

## 🔍 Overview

The notebook explores the following topics:
1. **COVID-19 Timeline**:
   - Transition from an epidemic to a global pandemic.
   - Key events that shaped the pandemic response.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Aggregated worldwide confirmed cases over time.
   - Regional trends and country-specific comparisons.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Line plots showing cumulative cases.
   - Comparative trends between regions (e.g., China vs. the rest of the world).

## 📚 Tools and Libraries

This project utilizes the following R libraries:
- **tidyverse**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: To create high-quality plots.
- **readr** and **dplyr**: For efficient data reading and transformation.
